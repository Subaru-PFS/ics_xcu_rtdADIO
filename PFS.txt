This is basically the vendor import of the RTD digital I/O control module, plus a small cython binding.

From RTD:
     aDIO_Linux_v03.01.00.tar.gz

This provides a kernel module in driver/, a library in lib/, and some examples/

We check in the built kernel and library to git, because the BEE image
cannot build modules, but the module cannot be built on other machines
without editing something in driver to force the selection of
__INTEL_MONTEVINA_CHIPSET.

From us:
     python/rtdADIO/
